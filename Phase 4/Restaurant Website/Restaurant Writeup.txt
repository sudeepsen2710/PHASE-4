1. At first I created 5 html files --> index.html, BestSeller.html, contact.html, signup.html and login.html files.

2. By using Bootstrap I created this website.

3. Created one Screenshot folder where I stored all the images related to Restaurant Website.

4. index.html is the home page, BestSeller.html contains all those dishes which are in demand and contact.html user can contact with the admin of the page.

5. The user can navigate between all the pages through common header.
